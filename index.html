            who
            developed my website. I know it has made an impression. What is more commendable is the fact that the
            website projects the very personality, tone & style of Avanke, perfectly. I am also thankful that I had
            the
            opportunity to work closely with Supun on Abacus, Marga and Active Vacations websites as well. I know

            has always been very professional. After I told him my imaginations, he knew right away what Rainbow
            Cupcakes is about. With his creative ideas, his endurance and experience he designed my logo. I really
            like
            about Supun that he is a perfectionist like I am. He tried everything until I was completely happy with
            the
            logo. I would also like to mention that he is very reliable, gets the job done fast and was really fun
            to
            work with. Even after our work together he made sure I posted the logo correctly on my page. I fully
            recommend Supun for any designing work and wish him all the best for his bright future. Thank you for
            giving
            me the perfect start into my business!”<br><br>

                has always been very professional. After I told him my imaginations, he knew right away what Rainbow
                Cupcakes is about. With his creative ideas, his endurance and experience he designed my logo. I really like
                about Supun that he is a perfectionist like I am. He tried everything until I was completely happy with the
                logo. I would also like to mention that he is very reliable, gets the job done fast and was really fun to
                work with. Even after our work together he made sure I posted the logo correctly on my page. I fully
                recommend Supun for any designing work and wish him all the best for his bright future. Thank you for giving
                me the perfect start into my business!”
