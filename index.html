            “I am invariably asked by my clients when I visit them for the very first time, the name of the company who
            developed my website. I know it has made an impression. What is more commendable is the fact that the
            website projects the very personality, tone & style of Avanke, perfectly. I am also thankful that I had the
            opportunity to work closely with Supun on Abacus, Marga and Active Vacations websites as well. I know that
            there will be more projects to come in the future. “

            “I am very happy that I chossed Supun to create my logo. From the beginning and through the whole process he
            has always been very professional. After I told him my imaginations, he knew right away what Rainbow
            Cupcakes is about. With his creative ideas, his endurance and experience he designed my logo. I really like
            about Supun that he is a perfectionist like I am. He tried everything until I was completely happy with the
            logo. I would also like to mention that he is very reliable, gets the job done fast and was really fun to
            work with. Even after our work together he made sure I posted the logo correctly on my page. I fully
            recommend Supun for any designing work and wish him all the best for his bright future. Thank you for giving
            me the perfect start into my business!”

            “I am invariably asked by my clients when I visit them for the very first time, the name of the company who
            developed my website. I know it has made an impression. What is more commendable is the fact that the
            website projects the very personality, tone & style of Avanke, perfectly. I am also thankful that I had the
            opportunity to work closely with Supun on Abacus, Marga and Active Vacations websites as well. I know that
            there will be more projects to come in the future. “

            technology with his passion for excellence. Supun strives to achieve cutting edge web solutions and is

            “I am very happy that I chossed Supun to create my logo. From the beginning and through the whole process he
            has always been very professional. After I told him my imaginations, he knew right away what Rainbow
            Cupcakes is about. With his creative ideas, his endurance and experience he designed my logo. I really like
            about Supun that he is a perfectionist like I am. He tried everything until I was completely happy with the
            logo. I would also like to mention that he is very reliable, gets the job done fast and was really fun to
            work with. Even after our work together he made sure I posted the logo correctly on my page. I fully
            recommend Supun for any designing work and wish him all the best for his bright future. Thank you for giving
            me the perfect start into my business!”
